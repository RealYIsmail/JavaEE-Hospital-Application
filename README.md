A web application that uses Java enterprise edition to produce a web application that can simulate the scenarios of a health care service. This is mainly written in Java for both the frontend, which also uses the bootstrap framework, and the backend of development and uses a SQL database to store user information.  The application works by first prompting the user to login so that they can access the dashboard of their role (Patient, doctor or admin) however if the user hasn't registered before then they can register which adds their information in the database. Upon successfully logging into the system the user will access a dashboard and is free to choose what they want within the limits of what their role is capable of doing, for example a patient can book an appointment but cannot check a doctor's schedule.
